# OOP
Python program that covers both activities with classes, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism:

Explanation:

Vehicle is the base class with attributes and an empty move() method.

Car, Plane, and Boat inherit from Vehicle and each implement their own version of move().

Constructors (__init__) initialize objects with unique data.

Polymorphism is demonstrated by calling the same method move() on different objects, each producing different behavior.
